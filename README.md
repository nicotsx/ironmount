## Intro

Ironmount is an easy to use web interface to manage your remote storage and mount them as local volumes on your server. Docker as a first class citizen, Ironmount allows you to easily mount your remote storage directly into your containers with few lines of code.

### Features

- ‚úÖ&nbsp; Support for multiple protocols: NFS, SMB, WebDAV, Directory
- üì°&nbsp; Mount your remote storage as local folders
- üê≥&nbsp; Docker integration: mount your remote storage directly into your containers via a docker volume syntax
- üîç&nbsp; Keep an eye on your mounts with health checks and automatic remounting on error
- üìä&nbsp; Monitor your mounts usage with detailed statistics and graphs

### Coming soon

- Automated backups with encryption and retention policies
- Integration with cloud storage providers (e.g. AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox)

## Installation

In order to run Ironmount, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server. Then, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to start the application.

```yaml
services:
  ironmount:
    image: ghcr.io/nicotsx/ironmount:v0.0.1
    container_name: ironmount
    restart: unless-stopped
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    ports:
      - "4096:4096"
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /run/docker/plugins:/run/docker/plugins
      - /var/lib/docker/volumes/:/var/lib/docker/volumes:rshared
      - ironmount_data:/data

volumes:
  ironmount_data:
    driver: local
```

Then, run the following command to start Ironmount:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Once the container is running, you can access the web interface at `http://<your-server-ip>:4096`.
